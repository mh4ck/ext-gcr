    <h2>How to Request a Car?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1: Launch the App</strong> Starting is as easy as launching
      our Gozo Car Rental app on your device. Simply tap on its icon on your
      home screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2: Navigate to 'Request' form</strong> Once the app is open,
      look for the 'Request' option in the bottom tab menu, and tap on it to
      begin the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3: Fill in the Form</strong> The form will ask for various
      details. You'll need to provide your prefered contact method, and the car
      specifications you're interested in. Take your time to fill out these
      fields accurately.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4: Submit Your Request</strong> Review all the information
      you have entered to ensure it's correct, then hit the 'Submit' button.
      Your request will then be sent to our network of car rental companies on
      Gozo.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 5: Wait for Confirmation</strong> You will receive a
      confirmation message through the app or via your prefered contact method.
      One of our affiliated car rental companies will contact you to complete
      the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Please note:</strong> Handling times can vary depending on the car
      rental company's workload and operational hours. Rest assured, we're
      dedicated to providing you with the best service possible and will strive
      to meet your needs in a timely manner.
